### An easy way of doing transfer learning for color fundus images processing tasks.
* Like vessel segmentation, Aretery/Vein classification, and optic disk segementation, exudates, segmentation/detection, and many more.
* It uses special custom Image transforms that works well with retinal images.
* A detailed explanation on transfer learning for retinal vessel segmentation with publicly available dataset to any datasets that does not have ground truth vessel mask available as follows:

### Step 1:
**Install pytorch and torchvision from [official website](https://pytorch.org/), and run:**

```
pip install easytorch==3.4.9
```

### Step 2:
* It comes with specifications to do transfer learning in directory [dataspecs/transfer.py](./dataspecs/transfer.py).
* Example specification for DRIVE dataset:

```python
def get_label_drive(file_name):
        return file_name.split('_')[0] + '_manual1.gif'

def get_mask_drive(file_name):
    return file_name.split('_')[0] + '_mask.gif'

DRIVE = {
    'name': f'DRIVE',
    'patch_shape': (388, 388),
    'patch_offset': (300, 300),
    'expand_by': (184, 184),
    'data_dir': 'DRIVE' + sep + 'images',
    'label_dir': 'DRIVE' + sep + 'manual',
    'mask_dir': 'DRIVE' + sep + 'mask',
    'label_getter': get_label_drive,
    'mask_getter': get_mask_drive,
    'resize': (896, 896),
    'thr_manual': 50
}
```
* We use U-Net model which works on patches of images with sliding window.
* After resizing, we need to binarize the ground truth using `thr_manual` threshold.
* This repo also includes a target dataset DDR for which we don't have vessel segmentation available. [DDR specification](./dataspecs/target.py). We want to do transfer learning from existing public datasets.
* Different ways we can do transfer learning for vessel segmentation:
  * We can either train by resizing all public datasets to approx same size as DDR. Thats what the `resize` is for in the above spec.  
  * We can train public dataset in a smaller size(this makes sense if target dataset is too large and hard to process), and also resize the DDR dataset to same size.
  * We train by using data augmentation; Simply train a model with different sizes of public dataset. It can get complicated because we need to resize the ground truths as well. But worry not, this code handles all of that.

### Finally:
**Case 1:** Run a working example on DDR dataset using two datasets(DRIVE and WIDE) for transfer learning.

`python main.py -ph train -data datasets --training-datasets DRIVE STARE --target-datasets DDR_train -spl 0.75 0.25 0 -b 8 -nw 6 -lr 0.001 -e 501 -pat 101 -rcw True`

**Case 2:** Use more datasets as below.

`python main.py -ph train -data <path to your dataset> --training-datasets DRIVE CHASEDB HRF IOSTAR STARE --target-datasets DDR_train -spl 0.75 0.25 0 -b 8 -nw 6 -lr 0.001 -e 501 -pat 101 -rcw True`

* This code uses `easytorch` framework and inherits some default args. Consult [easytorch repo](https://github.com/sraashis/easytorch) for details. But worry not, I will explain each of these.
  * **-ph** train: specifies which phase like train, test(for inference).
  * **-data** datasets: Path to your datasets so that you can run this code anywhere your data is. Just need to point to your datasets(Check [datasets](./datasets)) folder for an example.
  * **--training-dataset** ... : Which datasets to use for transfer learning from the specifications in [dataspecs](./dataspecs) directory. A single model will be trained using these datasets.
  * **--target-datasets** ... : After getting the best model, which dataset to use it on to generate vessel segmentation results.
  * **-spl** 0.75 0.25 0 : Split ratio for training dataset in order train, validation, test. We dont need test data for this transfer learning. We need validation set to pick the best model.
  * **-nw** 6 : num of workers
  * **-lr** 0.001 : Learning rate
  * **-e** 501: Epochs
  * **-pat** 101: patience to stop training. If model does not improve in previous 101 epochs, stop the training.
  * **-rcw** True : Stochastic weights scheme to improve prediction on fainter vessels as detailed in paper below(Dynamic Deep Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation).
